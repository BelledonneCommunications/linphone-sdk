Dependencies
************
*libtool
*intltool
*pkg-config
*libantlr3c-3.2 or 3.4
*antlr3-3.2 or 3.4
*C++ compiler (for instance g++ or clang++)
Newer versions won't compile.

Optional:
*CUinit-2.x
*polarssl>=1.2

Here is the command line to get these dependencies installed for Ubuntu && Debian:
	# apt-get install libtool intltool pkg-config libantlr3c-dev antlr3 g++ make 

	+ for optional library
	# apt-get install libcunit1-dev libpolarssl-dev


On windows you have to edit /usr/local/include/antl3defs.h
replace:
#include <winsock.h>
by:
#include <winsock2.h>

Or get the source code from linphone's git (linphone branch):
git clone -b linphone git://git.linphone.org/antlr3.git
git clone -b linphone git://git.linphone.org/cunit.git

* Building polarssl
Polarssl build system is Make (or Cmake). To build the shared library version, use "make SHARED=1 DEBUG=1", followed by "make install".
We maintain a branch of polarssl with automake/autoconf/libtool support at git://git.linphone.org/polarssl.git -b linphone

Prequisites
***********
You must jave 'java' in your PATH.


Build with mingw
****************
* Compile and install libantlr3c, CUnit with ./configure && make && make install
* Compile belle-sip.

Build with Visual Studio
************************
The procedure is tested for Visual Studio Express 2012.

* get antlr3 from linphone's git server (see above). This version contains up to date visual studio project and solution files.
* get CUnit from linphone's git server (see above). This version contains up to date visual studio project and solution files.
* put belle-sip next to antlr3 and to cunit (in the same directory).
* open belle-sip/build/windows/belle-sip-tester/belle-sip-tester.sln or belle-sip/build/windows/belle-sip/belle-sip.sln
* Build the solution (antlr3 and cunit are built automatically)

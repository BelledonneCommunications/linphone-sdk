Dependencies:

libantlr3c-3.4
antlr3-3.2
CUinit-2.x

Newer versions won't compile.

On windows you have to edit /usr/local/include/antl3defs.h
replace:
#include <winsock.h>
by:
#include <winsock2.h>

Or get the source code from linphone's git (linphone branch):
git clone -b linphone git://git.linphone.org/libantlr3c.git

What's Belr
===========

Belr is Belledonne Communications' language recognition library, written in C++11.
It aims at parsing any input formatted according to a language defined by an ABNF grammar,
such as the protocols standardized at IETF.
The recognized language elements are notified to the application through std::function provided to the parser by the application.

It is based on finite state machine theory and heavily relies on recursivity from an implementation standpoint.


Dependencies
============

- *bctoolbox[1]*: our portability layer


Build Belr
==========

		cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<search_prefixes>
		
		make
		make install


Build options
=============

* `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<string>`: install prefix
* `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<string>`: column-separated list of prefixes where to search for dependencies
* `ENABLE_SHARED=NO`: do not build the shared library
* `ENABLE_STATIC=NO`: do not build the static library
* `ENABLE_STRICT=NO`: build without strict compilation flags (-Wall -Werror)
* `ENABLE_TOOLS=NO`: do not build tools (belr-demo, belr-parse)


Note for packagers
==================

Our CMake scripts may automatically add some paths into research paths of generated binaries.
To ensure that the installed binaries are striped of any rpath, use `-DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH=ON`
while you invoke cmake.

Rpm packaging
belr can be generated with cmake3 using the following command:
mkdir WORK
cd WORK
cmake3 ../
make package_source
rpmbuild -ta --clean --rmsource --rmspec belr-<version>-<release>.tar.gz

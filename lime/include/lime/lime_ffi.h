/**
	@file lime_ffi.h

	@brief This header exports lime's functionality via a C89 interface.

	General rules of this API to make life easier to anyone trying to use it
	from another langage:
	- all interaction are done via pointer to opaque structure
	- use only simple types:
		- size_t for all buffer or array size
		- const char * NULL terminated strings
		- uint8_t * for binary buffers
	- no ownership of memory transfers across the API boundary.\n
	The API read data from const pointers and write output to buffers allocated by the caller.
	- when exporting a binary blob, the function takes a pointer to the output buffer and a read/write pointer to the length.\n
	If the size of the provided buffer is insufficient, an error is returned.

	@warning Check carefully the lime_ffi_decrypt function's documentation as an output buffer too small on this one mean you would loose your decrypted message forever.

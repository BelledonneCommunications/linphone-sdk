Lime
=======

LIME is an end-to-end encryption library for one-to-one and group instant messaging, allowing users to exchange messages privately and asynchronously.

LIME is composed of a portable client library coupled with a public key server developed by Belledonne Communications to allow end-to-end encryption for messaging, without having to exchange cryptographic keys simultaneously.

The library exposes a C++ API for easy integration in mobile and desktop environments.

LIME supports multiple devices per user and multiple users per device.

LIME library is dual-licensed and can be distributed either under a GNU GPLv3 license (open source, see *LICENSE.txt*) or under a proprietary
license (closed source).

The public key server (LIME server) is not part of this software package but can be found on the [lime server repository](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/lime-server)

Dependencies
------------
- *bctoolbox[1]* : portability layer, built with Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- *soci-sqlite[2]* : Db access
- *postquantumcryptoengine[3]* : abstraction layer to Kyber and MLKEM


Build instructions
------------------
```
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_prefix> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<search_prefix> <path_to_source>

 make
 make install
```

Alternatively, LIME library is integrated in *linphone-sdk* meta project, which provides a convenient way
to build it for various targets.

Documentation
-------------

To generate the Doxygen documentation files (having ran the cmake command with ENABLE_DOC On):

```
 make doc
```

Comprehensive documentation on implementation choices and built-in protocols in *lime.pdf*


Testing
-------
To test on local machine, you must run a local X3DH server.
 - A nodejs/sqlite version of UNSECURE X3DH server is provided in *tester/server/nodejs*
 See README from this directory for instructions.

If a local X3DH server is running with default parameter just run
```
 make test
```

To launch a particular test suite, use ctest, running:
```
 ctest -R <Test suite name> [--verbose]
```

Test suite names are
- *crypto*: Test the crypto primitives
- *double_ratchet*: Specific to the Double Ratchet protocol
- *hello_world*: Basic Lime test, mostly a demo code. Requires a live X3DH server on localhost
- *lime*: Complete testing of all features provided by the library. Requires a live X3DH server on localhost
- *multidomains*: Tests specific to the server multidomain management. Requires a live X3DH server on localhost, does not work with the nodejs server provided with the library.
- *server*: Tests some server configuration(resource usage limitation). Requires a live X3DH server on localhost, does not work with the nodejs server provided with the library.


Library settings
----------------
Some mostly harmless settings are available in *src/lime_settings.hpp*


Library APIs
-----------
The C++17 API is available in *include/lime/lime.hpp*

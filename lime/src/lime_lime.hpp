		 * @brief Encrypt a buffer(text or file) for a given list of recipient devices
		 * if specified localDeviceId is not found in local Storage, throw an exception
		 *
		 * 	Clarification on recipients:
		 *
		 * 	recipients information needed are a list of the device Id and one userId. The device Id shall be their GRUU while the userId is a sip:uri.
		 *
		 * 	recipient User Id is used to identify the actual intended recipient. Example: alice have two devices and is signed up on a conference having
		 * 	bob and claire as other members. The recipientUserId will be the conference sip:uri and device list will include:
		 * 		 - alice other device
		 * 		 - bob devices
		 * 		 - claire devices
		 * 	If Alice write to Bob only, the recipientUserId will be bob sip:uri and recipient devices list :
		 * 		 - alice other device
		 * 		 - bob devices
		 *
		 * 	In all cases, the identified source of the message will be the localDeviceId
		 *
		 * 	If the X3DH server can't provide keys for a peer device, its status is set to fail and its DRmessage is empty. Other devices get their encrypted message
		 * 	If no peer device could get encrypted for all of them are missing keys on the X3DH server, the callback will still be called with success exit status
		 *
		 * @note all parameters are shared pointers as the process being asynchronous, the ownership will be taken internally exempting caller to manage the buffers.
		 *
		 * @param[in]		recipientUserId		the Id of intended recipient, shall be a sip:uri of user or conference, is used as associated data to ensure no-one can mess with intended recipient
		 * @param[in,out]	recipients		a list of RecipientData holding:
		 * 						- the recipient device Id(GRUU)
		 * 						- an empty buffer to store the DRmessage which must then be routed to that recipient
		 * 						- the peer Status. If peerStatus is set to fail, this entry is ignored otherwise the peerStatus is set by the encrypt, see ::PeerDeviceStatus definition for details
		 * @param[in]		plainMessage		a buffer holding the message to encrypt, can be text or data.
		 * @param[in]		encryptionPolicy	select how to manage the encryption: direct use of Double Ratchet message or encrypt in the cipher message and use the DR message to share the cipher message key
		 * @param[out]		cipherMessage		points to the buffer to store the encrypted message which must be routed to all recipients(if one is produced, depends on encryption policy)
		 * @param[in]		callback		This operation contact the X3DH server and is thus asynchronous, when server responds,
		 * 					this callback will be called giving the exit status and an error message in case of failure.
		 * 					It is advised to capture a copy of cipherMessage and recipients shared_ptr in this callback so they can access
		 * 					the output of encryption as it won't be part of the callback parameters.

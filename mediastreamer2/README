Mediastreamer2 is a library to make audio and
video real-time streaming and processing. Written in pure C,
it is based upon the ortp library.

Design:
-------------------------------------

Using mediastreamer2 will allow you to chain filters in a graph. Each
filter will be responsible for doing some kind of processing and will
deliver data to the next filter. As an example, you could get some
data from network and unpack it in an RTP filter. This RTP filter will
deliver the data to a decoder (speex, G711...) which will deliver it
to a filter that is able to play the PCM data or record it into a .wav
file.

There is a doxygen documentation for more information.

Compilation and installation
-------------------------------------

* Required dependencies:
	- oRTP
	- libspeex and libspeexdsp
	- vim
* Optional dependencies (for video to be enabled, see --enable-video):
	- libavcodec
	- libswscale
	- libvpx
	- libopus
	- x11 with libxv-dev on linux
	- libmastroska2 from https://github.com/Matroska-Org/foundation-source
	- theora
	- libsrtp

  * For Linux, MacOS or mingw

   $> ./configure
   $> make
   $> su -c 'make install'

   More instructions and advices can be found for the mingw compilation procedure in Linphone's README.mingw.

  * Windows XP and later with Visual Studio 2010
	1) Make a directory where you have together:
		oRTP (clone from git://git.linphone.org/ortp.git )
		mediastreamer2 (clone from git://git.linphone.org/mediastreamer2.git)
		linphone-deps (directory to be created).
	2) Download latest linphone-deps-win32 zip from http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/linphone/misc/ and unpack it in the linphone-deps directory.
	3) open build/win32native/mediastreamer2.sln

/****************************************************************************/

/*        Voicing Detection (VOICIN) makes voicing decisions for each half */
/*  frame of input speech.  Tentative voicing decisions are made two frames*/
/*   in the future (2F) for each half frame.  These decisions are carried */
/*   through one frame in the future (1F) to the present (P) frame where */
/*   they are examined and smoothed, resulting in the final voicing */
/*   decisions for each half frame. */
/*        The voicing parameter (signal measurement) column vector (VALUE) */
/*   is based on a rectangular window of speech samples determined by the */
/*  window placement algorithm.  The voicing parameter vector contains the*/
/*  AMDF windowed maximum-to-minimum ratio, the zero crossing rate, energy*/
/*   measures, reflection coefficients, and prediction gains.  The voicing */
/*  window is placed to avoid contamination of the voicing parameter vector*/
/*   with speech onsets. */
/*        The input signal is then classified as unvoiced (including */
/*   silence) or voiced.  This decision is made by a linear discriminant */
/*   function consisting of a dot product of the voicing decision */
/*   coefficient (VDC) row vector with the measurement column vector */
/*  (VALUE).  The VDC vector is 2-dimensional, each row vector is optimized*/
/*   for a particular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  So, before the dot */
/*   product is performed, the SNR is estimated to select the appropriate */
/*   VDC vector. */
/*        The smoothing algorithm is a modified median smoother.  The */
/*  voicing discriminant function is used by the smoother to determine how*/
/*   strongly voiced or unvoiced a signal is.  The smoothing is further */
/*   modified if a speech onset and a voicing decision transition occur */
/*   within one half frame.  In this case, the voicing decision transition */
/*  is extended to the speech onset.  For transmission purposes, there are*/
/*   constraints on the duration and transition of voicing decisions.  The */
/*   smoother takes these constraints into account. */
/*        Finally, the energy estimates are updated along with the dither */
/*   threshold used to calculate the zero crossing rate (ZC). */

/*   LPC Processing control variables: */

/* *** Read-only: initialized in setup */

/*    and message and debug outputs. */

/* Here are the only files which use these variables: */

/* Many files which use fdebug are not listed, since it is only used in */

/* Subroutine SETUP is the only place where order is assigned a value, */
/* and that value is 10.  It could increase efficiency 1% or so to */
/* declare order as a constant (i.e., a Fortran PARAMETER) instead of as 
*/
/* a variable in a COMMON block, since it is used in many places in the */
/* core of the coding and decoding routines.  Actually, I take that back. 
*/
/* At least when compiling with f2c, the upper bound of DO loops is */
/* stored in a local variable before the DO loop begins, and then that is 
*/
/* compared against on each iteration. */
/* Similarly for lframe, which is given a value of MAXFRM in SETUP. */
/* Similarly for quant, which is given a value of 2400 in SETUP.  quant */
/* is used in only a few places, and never in the core coding and */
/* decoding routines, so it could be eliminated entirely. */
/* nbits is similar to quant, and is given a value of 54 in SETUP. */
/* corrp is given a value of .TRUE. in SETUP, and is only used in the */
/* subroutines ENCODE and DECODE.  It doesn't affect the speed of the */
/* coder significantly whether it is .TRUE. or .FALSE., or whether it is 
*/
/* a constant or a variable, since it is only examined once per frame. */
/* Leaving it as a variable that is set to .TRUE.  seems like a good */

/* *** Read/write: variables for debugging, not needed for LPC algorithm

*/
/*       1, 9" below.  I believe that this doesn't cause any problems in 
*/
/*       this subroutine, because all VDC(9,*) array elements are 0, and

*/

*/
/*       Local state */
/*       WARNING! */

/*       VOICE, SFBUE, and SLBUE should be saved from one invocation to */
/*       the next, but they are never given an initial value. */

/*       Does Fortran 77 specify some default initial value, like 0, or */

/*       For VOICE, note that it is "shifted" in the statement that */
/*       begins "IF (HALF .EQ. 1) THEN" below.  Also, uninitialized */
/*       values in the VOICE array can only affect entries in the VOIBUF 
*/
/*       array that are for the same frame, or for an older frame.  Thus 
*/
/*       the effects of uninitialized values in VOICE cannot linger on */
/*       for more than 2 or 3 frame times. */

/*       For SFBUE and SLBUE, the effects of uninitialized values can */
/*       linger on for many frame times, because their previous values */
/*       are exponentially decayed.  Thus it is more important to choose 
*/
/*       initial values for these variables.  I would guess that a */
/*       reasonable initial value for SFBUE is REF/16, the same as used */
/*       for FBUE and OFBUE.  Similarly, SLBUE can be initialized to */
/*       REF/32, the same as for LBUE and OLBUE. */

/*       These guessed initial values should be validated by re-running */
/*       the modified program on some audio samples. */

linphone-1.0.0:
	It seems ipv6 support is "broken". Some help is welcome.

linphone-0.12.0
	When compiling with gcc-2.95.4 on debian, an assert fails and cause abort()
	in libasound (alsa-lib). When compiling with gcc-3.2, it does not happen.
	It seems that asoundlib and linphone must be compiled with the same compiler.

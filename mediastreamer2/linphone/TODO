hot stuff:
---------

* ice support
* run a user given command upon incoming calls
* linphonec on win32
* RTP inactivity timeout to close lost calls.


low priority:
-------------

* random RTP ports (to enable direct mapping NAT)
* zeroconf support for advertising services (cool stuff!)
* have the possibility to define several profiles (config files) and switch between them
* display call duration
* help tips for the registration box
* The length (or duration) of the call could be displayed (see icons2.png)
* 2. There could be a sound effect for "busy" - a short "beep-beep-beep" would be      sufficient (try http://www.google.com/search?q=busy.wav)
* The call history could be a bit more clear (see history.png). And it
  should be saved somewhere, so you can track your calls if you need to...
* move resampling stuff to use speex instead of libresample.

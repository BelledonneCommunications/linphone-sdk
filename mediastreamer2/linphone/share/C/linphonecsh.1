.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Linphonecsh is a small utility to send basic commands to a linphonec (console mode linphone) process.
Unlike linphonec, linphonecsh does not wait commands from standart input: it takes the command from its arguments 
and sends it using unix pipe to a linphonec process started in daemon mode.
The motivation for this tool is for example to simply execute voip calls from scripts, web-servers, or javascript web pages.
.br 

The very first thing to do before doing actions is to ask linphonecsh to spawn a linphonec daemon using
.TP
\fBlinphonecsh init\fR
.br

When the linphonec daemon is no more needed, the following commands makes it exit properly:
.TP
\fBlinphonecsh exit\fR
.br

.SH "FILES"
.LP 
By default a linphonec started as a daemon by 'linphonecsh init' does not use a config file.

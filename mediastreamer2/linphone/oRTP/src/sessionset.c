/**
 *	This function performs similarly as libc select() function, but performs on #RtpSession 
 *	instead of file descriptors.
 *	session_set_select() suspends the calling process until some events arrive on one of the
 *	three sets passed in argument. Two of the sets can be NULL.
 *	The first set @recvs is interpreted as a set of RtpSession waiting for receive events:
 *	a new buffer (perhaps empty) is availlable on one or more sessions of the set, or the last
 *	receive operation with rtp_session_recv_with_ts() would have finished if it were in 
 *	blocking mode.
 *	The second set is interpreted as a set of RtpSession waiting for send events, i.e. the last
 *	rtp_session_send_with_ts() call on a session would have finished if it were in blocking mode.
 *	
 *	When some events arrived on some of sets, then the function returns and sets are changed
 *	to indicate the sessions where events happened.
 *	Sessions can be added to sets using session_set_set(), a session has to be tested to be 
 *	part of a set using session_set_is_set().
 *
 * @param recvs a set of rtp sessions to be watched for read events
 * @param sends a set of rtp sessions to be watched for write events
 * @param errors a set of rtp sessions to be watched for errors
 * @return: the number of sessions on which the selected events happened.

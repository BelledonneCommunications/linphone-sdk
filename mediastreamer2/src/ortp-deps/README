This directory contains a minimal version of oRTP containing only the generic
functionalities (logging, payload type definitions, b64...) that are mandatory
to be able to compile mediastreamer2 without the oRTP dependency
(configuration option --disable-ortp).

If some changes are made in oRTP they can be automatically synchronized here
thanks to the update_ortp.sh script.

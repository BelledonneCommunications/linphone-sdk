# LinphoneSDK as a NuGet package

## Build instructions

### LinphoneSDK.Xamarin

> ⚠ The NuGet package for Xamarin development with .NET can only be built from an Apple macOS operating system.

To build a NuGet package for Android & iOS development with Xamarin, you will first need to build (or download) the SDK for both Android and iOS, and make sure you have the C# wrapper (which can be generated by either of these builds).

```sh
mkdir build-nuget
cd build-nuget
cmake .. -DLINPHONESDK_CSHARP_WRAPPER_PATH="..." -DLINPHONESDK_ANDROID_AAR_PATH="..." -DLINPHONESDK_IOS_XCFRAMEWORKS_PATH="..." -DLINPHONESDK_VERSION="..."
cmake --build .
```

If you run cmake from the root of the `linphone-sdk` repository, then you will need to pass `-DLINPHONESDK_PACKAGER="Nuget"` as well.

You can take a look at the [`job-xamarin-package`](../../.gitlab-ci-files/job-packages.yml) CI job for an example invocation

This must be run on a macOS machine, but you don't have to pass any extra arguments: CMake will detect your system and configure accordingly.

### LinphoneSDK.Windows

> ⚠ The NuGet package for Windows development with .NET can only be built from a Microsoft Windows operating system.

You can package 3 kinds of binaries : win32, uwp and win32 with Windows Store Compatibility.

- win32: this is the win32 version of linphone-sdk without any restrictions. The framework is 'win'.
- uwp : this is a uwp x64 version of linphone-sdk. You will not be able to use OpenH264 and Lime X3DH. The framework is 'uap10.0'.
- win32 Windows Store : this is the win32 version of linphone-sdk with the Windows Store Compatibility enabled for Windows Bridge. The framework is 'netcore'.

In an another build folder (like build-nuget), set these options :
- (Needed) `-DLINPHONESDK_PACKAGER=Nuget`
- (Optional) `-DLINPHONESDK_DESKTOP_ZIP_PATH=<path of the zip file containing the Desktop binaries>` (eg. C:/projects/desktop-uwp/linphone-sdk/buildx86/linphone-sdk) 
- (Optional) `-DLINPHONESDK_UWP_ZIP_PATH=<path of the zip file containing the UWP binaries>` (eg. C:/projects/desktop-uwp/linphone-sdk/builduwp/linphone-sdk)
- (Optional) `-DLINPHONESDK_WINDOWSSTORE_ZIP_PATH=<path of the zip file containing the Desktop binaries with Store compatibility enabled>` (eg. C:/projects/desktop-uwp/linphone-sdk/buildx86_store/linphone-sdk)

Build the Package:

```sh
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config=RelWithDebInfo
```

The nuget package will be in `linphone-sdk/packages`
The generated package can keep the same file name between generations on the same git version.
Visual studio keeps a cache and you need to delete its internal folder to force a new packaging.
The folder can be found in your system path at `<User>/.nuget/packages/linphonesdk`

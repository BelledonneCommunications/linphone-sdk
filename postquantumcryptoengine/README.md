Depends
-------

- **liboqs[1]**: implementation of a collection of Post Quantum algorithms
- **bctoolbox[2]**


To compile
----------

	cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install prefix> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<search prefix>

	make
	make install


To make an rpm package
----------------------

	cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR="RPM"

	make package


Options
-------

- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<string>`: install prefix.
- `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<string>`: search path prefix for dependencies e.g. mbedtls.
- `ENABLE_STRICT=NO`: do not build with strict compilator flags e.g. `-Wall -Werror`.
- `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=NO`: do not build testing binaries.



Note for packagers
------------------

Our CMake scripts may automatically add some paths into research paths of generated binaries.
To ensure that the installed binaries are striped of any rpath, use `-DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH=ON`
while you invoke cmake.

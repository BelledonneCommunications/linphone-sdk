msx264 - a GPL plugin to bring video H264 encoding/decoding capabilities to mediastreamer2 applications.
It is based on ffmpeg for decoding and x264 for encoding.

It works with x264 version later to september 2009. 
So:

* compile msx264 with ./configure && make && make install


A bit of history
****************

The multislicing feature of x264 is something that has been contributed several time, but never merged (why ?).
The linphone.org version of x264 was inspired by a patch submitted on x264-devel mailing list:
http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/x264-devel/2008-April/004427.html
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/linphone/plugins/sources/x264-snapshot-20090704-linphone-org.tar.gz
This version is no more required since in august 2009, x264 team introduces new parameters
controlling slicing.

In pseudo-order of priority: 
---------------------------

- Exctract presence info in friends list

- Allow friend call arg to be a pattern

- hide input during password insertions
	[ could use ncurses noecho() ]

- Allow for single-shot mode (call somebody and quit after the fact)
  maybe "linphonec [OPTS] <sip-uri>" would do..
  Unfortunately the -s switch would confuse people, I'd rather
  change its semantic to "source file" where file wold contain
  a list of commands, so ./linephone -s myfriend.sip would call
  yourfriend...

- implement "smart" command completion

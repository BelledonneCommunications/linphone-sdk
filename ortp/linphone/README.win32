		Linphone win32 build HOW-TO
		***************************

Linphone for windows requires the wxDev-C++ IDE (integrated with mingw32 compiler) from
http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/
However wxWidget is not used or required here.
Inno setup compiler is required to make the binary package:
http://www.innosetup.com/

Follows the list of linphone's dependencies:
For engine (ie liblinphone):
1/ libspeex>=1.1.11
2/ libtheora
3/ libogg
4/ libavcodec and libavutil (ffmpeg)
5/ libosip2>=3.1.0
6/ libeXosip2>=3.1.0
7/ libgsm
For the gtk+/glade graphical interface:
8/ gtk+ and all its mandatory dependencies
9/ iconv
10/ libxml2
11/ libglade>=2.4.0

All dependencies must be built with mingw32, gcc>=4.2.0 being required for ffmpeg to get it properly working.
How to get them built is unspecified here.
First build 1-9 items and install them into a linphone-deps directory as follows:
linphone-deps/bin: all dlls
linphone-deps/lib: all lib*.a (interface libraries)
linphone-deps/include: all header files
This linphone-deps directory should be placed next to the linphone base directory (in the same parent directory).
As getting 1-9 dependencies built can be very long and complex (such as for ffmpeg), I provide a linphone-deps bundle so 
that you have nothing to do, here:
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/linphone/misc/

The simpler to get binaries and header files for 8-11 dependencies is to trust people who are making
binary packages for them :
You can download:
- gtk+>=2.12.2 all-in-one bundle 
	from http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
	or directly http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.14/gtk+-bundle_2.14.2-20080919_win32.zip
- iconv from http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/
- libxml2 from http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/
- libglade bin and dev package from http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net
	or directly http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98754&package_id=107065 
Unzip gtk+ bundle, iconv and libxml2 into the same directory as "linphone-deps"
Inside the gtk+ bundle, unzip libglade bin and dev zips.

Once you have all this, you are ready to build linphone.
With wxDev-C++, open the following .dev files included in linphone's source tree,
and for each of them click on the "rebuild all" wxDev-C++ menu item:
oRTP/build/win32native/ortp-dll.dev
mediastreamer2/build/win32native/mediastreamer2.dev
coreapi/liblinphone.dev
gtk-glade/linphone.dev

Now you just need to make a binary package with Inno Setup Compiler.
With this tool, open 
gtk-glade/linphone.iss
and click "compile" to generate the setup.exe

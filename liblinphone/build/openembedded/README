Instructions for compilation from sources: (requires 10 Go of free space)
- Choose a distribution and build it.
  For example, to build Angstrom follow the guide at http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom
  For IGEPv2 use environment variable MACHINE=igep0020
  It is possible to use MACHINE=qemuarm to build an image that can be run on a computer with qemu.

- Add linphone recipes to the pool with an higher priority:
  Edit conf/bblayers.conf to set EXTRALAYERS to point to the source repository of linphone. Search the EXTRALAYERS definition in conf/bblayers.conf
  and modify it like this:

     # Add your overlay location to EXTRALAYERS
     # Make sure to have a conf/layers.conf in there
     EXTRALAYERS ?= "/home/smorlat/sources/git/linphone-daemon/build/openembedded"

  This additional layer gives access to the various linphone recipes but also to a recipe to build an entire image containing linphone.
  To build this image based on the generic console image you will need to use:
  bitbake console-linphone-image


- Prepare compilation
  Source appropriate environment with "~/.oe/enviro*"  
  Change directory to where you launched Angstrom install script.

- Compile linphone
  bitbake -c clean linphone
  bitbake linphone

- If you want additional codecs (e.g. iLBC or AMR) compile linphone-plugins
  bitbake -c clean linphone-plugins
  bitbake linphone-plugins

- Find the generated packages "*.ipk"
  Example: /Data/work/angstrom/angstrom-setup-scripts/build/tmp-angstrom_2008_1/deploy/glibc/ipk/armv7a/



 
Installation
- check network connectivity
	* ping linphone.org
	* see "route -n"
	* see "/etc/resolv.conf"
- update package list
	* opkg update
- copy ipk files to install to /tmp
- eventually remove previously installed packages
- install with "opkg install libortp*.ipk libmediastreamer*.ipk liblinphone*.ipk linphonec*.ipk"

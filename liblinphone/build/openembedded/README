Instructions for compilation from sources: (requires 10 Go of free space)
- Choose a distribution and build it.
  For example, to build Angstrom follow the guide at http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom
  For IGEPv2 use environment variable MACHINE=igep0020

- Add linphone recipes to the pool with an higher priority:
  Edit conf/bblayers.conf to set EXTRA_LAYERS to the source repository of linphone:
     # Add your overlay location to EXTRALAYERS
     # Make sure to have a conf/layers.conf in there
     EXTRALAYERS ?= "/home/smorlat/sources/git/linphone-daemon/build/openembedded"


- Prepare compilation
  Source appropriate environment with "~/.oe/enviro*"  
  Change directory to where you launched Angstrom install script.

- Compile linphone / linphonec
  bitbake -c clean linphone
  bitbake linphone


- Find the generated packages "*.ipk"
  Example: /Data/work/angstrom/angstrom-setup-scripts/build/tmp-angstrom_2008_1/deploy/glibc/ipk/armv7a/

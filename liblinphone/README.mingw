* Download and install Inno Setup Compiler (required only if you run 'make setup.exe'). Add it to your windows Path environment variable.

************************

Install msys-git from (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/). During installation you are asked to make a choice about how line endings are treated by git.
Choose "Checkout line endings as they are, commit as they are". THIS CHOICE IS VERY IMPORTANT. OTHERS BREAK AUTOMAKE.

It is recommended that you create a directory somewhere with a path without any spaces or ~ characters, for example
c:\sources\
Within msys-git bash, do
cd /c/sources
git clone git://git.linphone.org/linphone.git --recursive


Building
********

WARNING: During the build, windows might slow down suddenly. Using ctl+alt+del to start the windows system monitor,
 you might see a process 'LVpSRV.exe' or something like this that eats 90% of cpu.
Kill it. Don't know what it is, but once killed, windows runs normally.

#Compile and install tunnel (optional, available under proprietary licensing)

cd tunnel && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --disable-static  && make && make install

#Build linphone itself:
#run autogen.sh after a git checkout or update

./autogen.sh

./configure --prefix=/opt/linphone --enable-shared --disable-static
#note: in order to use the tunnel, append --enable-tunnel to the configure line above.

#compile:

make

#now install to /opt/linphone, required for compilation of plugins.

make install

#make a binary zip of linphone

make zip

#additionally you can make binary installer if you have Inno Setup 5 installed in its default path

make setup.exe

#now you're done, you have a fresh linphone windows installer in the current directory.



#build plugins
cd mediastreamer2/plugins/msx264
./autogen.sh

#make a binary zip of this plugin
make zip
#or make an installer
make setup.exe

#the buddylookup plugin enables lookup of buddies in a remote database using xml-rpc over http/https.
cd coreapi/plugins/buddylookup

******************************************************
*      Notes about linphone-deps generation          *
******************************************************

Linphone-deps is a collection of linphone dependencies, that are for some of them difficult
to find as windows binaries.
These notes are useful if you want to upgrade part of the software that is included in the
linphone-deps packages.

List of software included in linphone-deps:
libosip2  (compiled)
libeXosip2 (compiled)
libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavdevice, libswscale (compiled, all these from ffmpeg)
libtheora (from the web)
libx264 (compiled from the version distributed from linphone's web site)
libogg (from the web)
libspeex, libspeexdsp (compiled, statically to workaround a dll-related crash)
libgnutls (from the web)
libgsm (from the web)
libxml2 (compiled)
libsoup (compiled)
libsqlite3 (compiled)

Remarks:
For every package compiled that goes into linphone-deps, .la files (libtool files) must be removed to avoid libtool errors.
When running "make install DESTDIR=<somepath>", somepath must be absolute and should not contain any ~ or space.

- building sqlite3
  * download the sources on the following website:
  http://www.sqlite.org/download.html (choose the sqlite-autoconf-3XXX.tar.gz)
  
  * install: 
  ./configure
  make && make install DESTDIR=/home/<myuser>/sqlite3-install
  then copy the content of ~/sqlite3-install/usr/local/ into linphone-deps/. 	

- building ffmpeg 
  ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-memalign-hack --extra-cflags="-fno-common" --enable-gpl && make
  make install DESTDIR=/home/<myuser>/ffmpeg-install
  Copy to ~/ffmpeg-install/usr/local/* to linphone-deps/.
  Copy also all *.dll.a files from the build tree to lib/ directort of linphone-deps. These are the implibs necessary to link a program against the dlls.

- building libxml2: the binaries found on the internet are generated with MSVC++, and for obscure reason they are not suitable for building libsoup 
  (that requires libxml2).
  ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static && make && make install DESTDIR=/home/<myuser>/libxml2-install
  copy ~/libxml2-install/usr/local/* into linphone-deps/.


- building x264:
 
  * download yasm normal version windows executable from yasm project page:
  http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/wiki/Download
  copy it as /usr/local/bin/yasm.exe

  cd into x264/ dir then run:
  ./configure --enable-pic
  make
  make install DESTDIR=/home/<myuser>/x264-install
  then copy the content of ~/x264-install/usr/local/ into linphone-deps/.

- libgnutls (required for libsoup https support)
	- download binary zip from http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win.org
	- add to linphone-deps

- building libsoup (only required for buddylookup plugin)
	- download source from gnome ftp (warning: at the time of the writing only version 2.26.x can compile with the 
		glib version supplied in the gtk-bundle, 2.27 requires a new version of glib)
	- uncompress libgnutls zip in /
	- make sure you have libxml2 installed in /
	- apply a bugfix patch (fix gnutls support on windows, completely broken otherwise). The patch
		is in linphone-deps/src, apply it this way:
		cd libsoup-2.26.*
		cd libsoup
		patch -p0 < libsoup-gnutls-bugfix.patch
	- run:
		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --disable-static
		make
		make install
		make install DESTDIR=/home/<myuser>/libsoup-install
	- copy ~/libsoup-install/usr/* into linphone-deps/

Once you have everything in linphone-deps, remove .la files from lib:
	cd lib && rm -f *.la

    The passwd membership service provides a Membership Service implementation
   which is based on a password scheme similar to the POSIX
   <code>/etc/passwd</code> system.</code>
 
   <p/><strong>This implementation is intended as an example of a
   simple Membership Service and <em>NOT</em> as a practical secure
   Membership Service.<strong>

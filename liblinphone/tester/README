This is the test suite of liblinphone, with many tests suites for Register, Calls, Message, Presence.

All thoses tests suites require a SIP server configured accordingly in order to execute. Naturally a Flexisip SIP server is used, whose configuration is put in the flexisip/ directory here.

In order to invoke it, just place into the tester directory and run 
$ flexisip --configfile flexisip/flexisip.conf

The tester_hosts file contains the host-like DNS configuration file to be used by the test suite in order to resolve the virtual SIP domains used by the SIP stack.
It is possible to run the flexisip SIP server and the test suite on the same machine by passing a new tester_hosts file where domains resolve to 127.0.0.1 to the tester, using the --dns-hosts option.

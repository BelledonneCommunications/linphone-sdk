hot stuff:
---------

* ice support
* run a user given command upon incoming calls
* SIP/TLS

low priority:
-------------

* zeroconf support for advertising services (cool stuff!)
* have the possibility to define several profiles (config files) and switch between them
* help tips for the registration box
* 2. There could be a sound effect for "busy" - a short "beep-beep-beep" would be      sufficient (try http://www.google.com/search?q=busy.wav)

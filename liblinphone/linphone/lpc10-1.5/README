             LPC-10 2400 bps Voice Coder
                   Release 1.5
                   October 1997

(Note that this release 1.5 is not from any "official" source.  It is
from Andy Fingerhut.  Contact information below.)

This package is available from:

New in release 1.5:

Just some minor fixes to sample applications "nuke" and "unnuke" that
caused them not to work correctly on compilers with 16 bit int's.
This was only a bug in the sample application code, not in the LPC-10
library itself.

NEW IN RELEASE 1.4!

You can now compress (or decompress) multiple audio streams
"simultaneously", by alternating the compression (or decompression) of
frames for each audio stream.  Only the C version supports this
feature, but who really cared whether the Fortran version supported
this or not, eh?

   README               - This file
   README-1.0           - The original README file from Release 1.0
   FAQ                  - Frequently Asked Questions items for LPC and CELP
   lpc55                - modified Fortran code for LPC-10 Version 55
      README            - summary of modifications made
      README.f2c        - hints on installing f2c on some machines,
                          and notes on the f2c invocation options used
      README.jaf        - hints on using the LPC-10 coder from a C application
      RCS               - Revision Control System directory containing
                          master files for all sources, showing the steps
                          of changes that I made to the original 1.0 sources.
   lpc55-C              - Hand-modified C version of code, most of
                          which was created by running f2c on the
                          Fortran code in directory lpc55 above.  I'm
                          fairly certain that the C code from the 1.0
                          release was out of date with respect to the
                          Fortran code, so it was not included in this
                          distribution.
   data                 - Sample speech files, containing:
      dam9.spd          - Sample input speech file
      dam9-out.spd      - Speech processed by modified Fortran code.
                          This is identical to dam9_lpc55.spd from
                          release 1.0, except for 180 0 samples at the
                          beginning, and many samples here and there
                          that are off by 1, probably due to different
                          rounding of reals.
   abtool_1.2	        - Sun GUI tool for playing listening comparisons
			   between speech files (this is a beta version)
   misc
      bin               - Several useful shell scripts for audio on Sun machines
         README         - Description of audio file formats
      fortran-locals    - Some files I made when determining whether local
                          variables in Fortran subroutines and functions
                          were like C "static" local variables or not.
      gcc-2.6.0-bug     - A program that demonstrates a bug in GCC 2.6.0
                          on the Solaris 2.4 machine siesta.cs.wustl.edu.
                          I don't know how widespread this problem is,
                          but it does have an unpleasant side effect if
                          GCC 2.6.0 is used to compile f2c.

See also the file README-1.0 for some other useful details.

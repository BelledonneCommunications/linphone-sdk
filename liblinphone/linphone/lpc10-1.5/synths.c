/* ***************************************************************** */

/* The note below is from the distributed version of the LPC10 coder. */
/* The version of the code below has been modified so that SYNTHS always */
/* has a constant frame length output of MAXFRM. */

/* Also, BSYNZ and DEEMP need not be modified to work on variable */
/* positions within an array.  It is only necessary to pass the first */
/* index desired as the array argument.  What actually gets passed is the */
/* address of that array position, which the subroutine treats as the */
/* first index of the array. */

/* This technique is used in subroutine ANALYS when calling PREEMP, so it */
/* appears that multiple people wrote different parts of this LPC10 code, */
/* and that they didn't necessarily have equivalent knowledge of Fortran */
/* (not surprising). */

/*  NOTE: There is excessive buffering here, BSYNZ and DEEMP should be */
/*        changed to operate on variable positions within SOUT.  Also, */
/*        the output length parameter is bogus, and PITSYN should be */
/*        rewritten to allow a constant frame length output. */

/* Input: */
/*  VOICE  - Half frame voicing decisions */
/*           Indices 1 through 2 read. */
/* Input/Output: */
/*  PITCH  - Pitch */
/*           PITCH is restricted to range 20 to 156, inclusive, */
/*           before calling subroutine PITSYN, and then PITSYN */
/*           can modify it further under some conditions. */
/*  RMS    - Energy */
/*           Only use is for debugging, and passed to PITSYN. */
/*           See comments there for how it can be modified. */
/*  RC     - Reflection coefficients */
/*           Indices 1 through ORDER restricted to range -.99 to .99, */
/*           before calling subroutine PITSYN, and then PITSYN */
/*           can modify it further under some conditions. */
/* Output: */
/*  SPEECH - Synthesized speech samples. */
/*           Indices 1 through the final value of K are written. */
/*  K      - Number of samples placed into array SPEECH. */

/*    and message and debug outputs. */

/* Here are the only files which use these variables: */

/* Many files which use fdebug are not listed, since it is only used in */
/* those other files conditionally, to print trace statements. */

/*  LPC order, Frame size, Quantization rate, Bits per frame, */
/*    Error correction */
/* Subroutine SETUP is the only place where order is assigned a value, */
/* and that value is 10.  It could increase efficiency 1% or so to */
/* declare order as a constant (i.e., a Fortran PARAMETER) instead of as 
*/
/* a variable in a COMMON block, since it is used in many places in the */
/* core of the coding and decoding routines.  Actually, I take that back. 
*/
/* At least when compiling with f2c, the upper bound of DO loops is */
/* stored in a local variable before the DO loop begins, and then that is 
*/
/* compared against on each iteration. */
/* Similarly for lframe, which is given a value of MAXFRM in SETUP. */
/* Similarly for quant, which is given a value of 2400 in SETUP.  quant */
/* is used in only a few places, and never in the core coding and */
/* decoding routines, so it could be eliminated entirely. */
/* nbits is similar to quant, and is given a value of 54 in SETUP. */
/* corrp is given a value of .TRUE. in SETUP, and is only used in the */
/* subroutines ENCODE and DECODE.  It doesn't affect the speed of the */
/* coder significantly whether it is .TRUE. or .FALSE., or whether it is 
*/
/* a constant or a variable, since it is only examined once per frame. */
/* Leaving it as a variable that is set to .TRUE.  seems like a good */
/* idea, since it does enable some error-correction capability for */
/* unvoiced frames, with no change in the coding rate, and no noticeable 
*/
/* quality difference in the decoded speech. */

/* iclip is initialized to 0 in SETUP, and incremented in entry SWRITE in 
*/
/* sread.f.  When LPC10 is embedded into an application, one might want */
/* to cause it to be incremented in a routine that takes the output of */
/* SYNTHS and sends it to an audio device.  It could be optionally */
/* displayed, for those that might want to know what it is. */
/* maxosp is never initialized to 0 in SETUP, although it probably should 
*/

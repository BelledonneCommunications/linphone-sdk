This code was extracted from the mplayer 
project (http://mplayerhq.hu) and slimmed down to support
only audio codecs.  Apparently the mplayer project extracted 
it from the Wine project (http://winehq.org).


The difficult work to load and use the Windows DLLs and emulate the 
Windows ACM interface was done by (at a minimum) the following 
individuals from the mplayer and Wine projects
as found in the current body of source code:

Eugene Kuznetsov (divx@euro.ru) - WIN32 binary loader interface
                                   shamelessly stolen from Wine
Bertho A. Stultiens - Elf-dll loader functions
Felix Buenemann <atmosfear at users dot sourceforge dot net> - CPU detection
Alexandre Julliard - modules, pe_resource, lots of wine code
Eric Youndale - pe_image
Erik Bos - pe_image
Martin von Loewis - pe_image, pe_resource
Marcus Meissner - pe_image
Thomas Sandford - pe_resource
Robert J. Amstadt - pe_resource


The extraction from mplayer, slimming down, and use for encoding
TrueSpeech was done by the following individuals:

Robert W. Brewer <rbrewer at op.net> - test_truespeech.c, win32codec.c,
                                           slimming, and documentation

Piotr P. Karwasz <karwasz at clipper.en.fr> - initial extraction from
                                           mplayer code and example 
                                           loading of TrueSpeech dll

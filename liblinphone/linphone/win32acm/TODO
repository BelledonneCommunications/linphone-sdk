and Makefile.

fix segfault when closing acmStreams.  Looks like it could
have something to do with using 2 streams at the same time
and then deallocating them.  Appears that acmStreamClose()
attempting to close the driver when it is done is the wrong
thing.  Maybe need reference counting of the driver so that
subsequent acmStreamOpen() calls just increment a refcount,
acmStreamClose() decrements it and when it reaches 0 it 
closes the driver.  Maybe make a simple test program to 
open two acmStreams and then close them and see what happens.
Could run it under etrace for extra understanding.  For
now the code in win32codec_destroy is commented out so 
codecs are not properly destroyed.  We can probably live with
a memory leak like that for a while.

test with other audio codecs besides TrueSpeech.



***** DONE ******

document the general procedure needed to get a new codec
working with the library.

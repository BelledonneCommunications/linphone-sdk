msx264 - a GPL plugin to bring video H264 encoding/decoding capabilities to mediastreamer2 applications.
It is based on ffmpeg for decoding and x264 for encoding.

It works with any version of x264. However if you want better performance and interroperability, it is 
highly recommended to use a modified x264 version patched with the patch mentionned here:
http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/x264-devel/2008-April/004427.html

Unfortunately for bad reasons this patch hasn't been merged by x264 developpers, and no more applies with
recent versions.

This patch enables multi-slicing, ie smaller video packets that fit into the network mtu.
It enable RFC3984 packetization-mode=0 to work.
A x264 version modified by this patch can be found here:
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/linphone/plugins/sources/x264-snapshot-20080421-2245+multislicing-patch.tar.gz

So compile x264-snapshot-20080421-2245+multislicing-patch.tar.gz with ./configure && make && make install
Then compile msx264 with ./configure --enable-hacked-x264 && make && make install

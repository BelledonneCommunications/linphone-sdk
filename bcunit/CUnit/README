			  http://cunit.sourceforge.net

CUnit is a Unit testing framework for C. The Basic Framework is platform/version independent and should be 
portable to all the platform with some wrappers airound them for the platform specific handlers should as 
for UI handling in Windows based GUI Applications.

Linux:
	GNU packages such as Automake and Autoconf should be available. steps to be followed for
	installation are as follows:
		1> ./configure --prefix<Your choice of directory for installation>
		2> Make sure that ur directory name reflects the version and release.
		2> make
		3> make install

	What get's installed:
		1> libcunit.a (Library files)
		2> CUnit Header files
		3> Share Data which event includes the example application under their respective
		   directories.
		4> Man Pages in relevant man directories under the installation path.

Windows:
	VC++ Should be installed for using this. Although the code is any package independent but the 
	Windows Resources and the project/workspace are built in VC++ so if you are using some other
	development platform then you'll have to port the Workspace/Project/resources files to that i
	particular environment.

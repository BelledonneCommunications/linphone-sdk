			CUnit : A Unit Testing Framework
			  http://cunit.sourceforge.net

CUnit is a Unit testing framework for C. The Basic framework is 
platform/version independent and should be portable to all platforms
with some wrappers airound them for the platform specific handlers 
such as for UI handling in Windows based GUI Applications.

All Platforms:
  A set of Jamfiles has been provided for cross-platform building
  of the library and examples.  The jam build system was implemented
  using ftjam (http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html).  It has been
  tested under gcc/Linux, Borland/Windows, and VC++7/Windows, but
  should be readily extended to other platforms.  The jam file set
  supports both standard and custom symbolic build targets (install,
  uninstall, clean, libcunit, examples).

  1. (*nix) run autoconf and configure to generate custom Jamrules file
  2. Edit the top section of Jamrules to match your preferences
  3. jam install

Linux:
	In addition to jam, the standard GNU build system is supported.  The usual
  sequence of steps should succeed in building and installing CUnit:
		1. aclocal  (if necessary)
    2. autoconf (if necessary)
    3. automake (if necessary)
    4. chmod u+x configure (if necessary)
    2. ./configure --prefix<Your choice of directory for installation>
		3. make
		4. make install

	What's installed:
		1. libcunit.a (Library file)
		2. CUnit Header files
		3. DTD and XSL files supporting xml output files in Share directory
		4. Man Pages in relevant man directories under the installation path.

Windows:
	In addition to jam, VC++ project files are also included.
	Windows Resources and the project/workspace are built in VC++ so if you 
  are using some other development platform then you may have to port the 
  Workspace/Project/resources files to that particular environment.

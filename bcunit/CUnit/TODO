Longer term CUnit upgrade ideas:

1. Signal handling based exception catching for some invalid memory access by
   the group or test case in which case the test case/group execution should be
   terminated and it should proceed with the next test case/group in line.
2. Consider having CU_automated_run_tests take an argument specifying the
   filename root.
3. Run tests in a separate thread, provide mechanism for pausing or halting
   test run.
4. Provide mechanism to parse a source tree and automatically generate a
   test runner to call all suite set-up functions defined in the tree.
5. Windows interface.
6. Remove need for suites and tests to have unique (case-insensitive) names.
   It is nice for reporting, and selection of suites and tests in the
   current console/curses interfaces, but not really essential.  Selection
   could be by order or name, with the assigning of unique names left to
   the user.  Seems more like a recommended practice than a requirement.

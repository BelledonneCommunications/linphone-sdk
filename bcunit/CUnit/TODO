Certain validation and other neccesary features to be added in the coming days
are as follows:

1>	Port Makefile to DOS platform to work with MAKE provided with TC.
2> 	Unique group name identification in the TestRegistry (Currently we can have
	multiple groups with the same name).
3>	Signal handling based exception catching for some invalid memory access by
	the group or test case in which case the test case/group execution should be
	terminated and it should proceed with the next test case/group in line.
4>	To use AutoConf/AutoMake for the build/install configuration.
5>	Man page for the basic functions provided by the package.
6>	Curses based interface for the UNIX systems.
7>	Windows/XWindows based interface for Windows/XWindows systems.

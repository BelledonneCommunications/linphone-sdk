Certain validation and other neccesary features to be added in the coming days
are as follows:

1>	Port Makefile to DOS platform to work with MAKE provided with TC.
2>	Signal handling based exception catching for some invalid memory access by
	the group or test case in which case the test case/group execution should be
	terminated and it should proceed with the next test case/group in line.

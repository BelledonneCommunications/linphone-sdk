Longer term CUnit upgrade ideas:

1. Signal handling based exception catching for some invalid memory access by
   the group or test case in which case the test case/group execution should be
   terminated and it should proceed with the next test case/group in line.

2. Consider having CU_automated_run_tests take an argument specifying the
   filename root.

3. Run tests in a separate thread, provide mechanism for pausing or halting
   test run.

4. Provide mechanism to parse a source tree and automatically generate a
   test runner to call all suite set-up functions defined in the tree.

5. Windows interface.

6. Make test framework multi-thread safe.  The current dependence on
   static globals without access control will need to be addressed.

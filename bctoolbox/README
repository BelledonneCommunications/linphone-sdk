Utilities library used by Belledonne Communications softwares like belle-sip, mediastreamer2 and linphone.

Depends on mbedtls (https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls.git). For backward compatibility, support of polarssl is also provided.

To compile
----------

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install prefix>

make
make install

To make an rpm package
---------------------
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR="RPM"

make package 

Options
-------

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: install prefix  
ex:
	cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt  

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: search path prefix for polarssl or mbetls  
ex:
	cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<polarssl or mbtls path>  

ENABLE_POLARSSL: force usage of polarssl 
ex:
	cmake . -DENABLE_POLARSSL=ON -DENABLE_MBEDTLS=OFF  

ENABLE_MBEDTLS: force usage of mbedtls
ex:
	cmake . -DENABLE_POLARSSL=OFF -DENABLE_MBEDTLS=ON  



For backward compatibility with distributions not having the required 3.x cmake version, an automake/autoconf build system is also available.
It is maintained as a best effort and then should be used only in last resort.
